# OmegaSudokuSolver

A rule-based Sudoku solving algorithm implementation in C#. 
This repository contains the code for a Sudoku board checker, a Sudoku solver and 
a CLI for solving Sudoku problems and displaying their solution. The CLI supports 
reading and solving Sudoku puzzles directly from the command-line, or reading Sudoku 
puzzles from files and writing their solutions into files. 

The solver is built to run on .NET 8.0 (Visual Studio 2022)
